<p>A building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such
    as a house or factory. Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted
    throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land
    prices, ground conditions, specific uses, and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term building compare the
    list of nonbuilding structures. <br><br>

    Buildings serve several societal needs â€“ primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to
    store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the
    human habitat (a place of comfort and safety) and the outside (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).
    <br><br>
    Ever since the first cave paintings, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. In
    recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the
    design process of many new buildings.</p>
